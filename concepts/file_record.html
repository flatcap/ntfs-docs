    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
    The MFT is a set of FILE records.  Each file of the volume is completely
    described by one or more of these FILE Records.  File Records are
    equivalent to inodes in Unix terminology.  The first FILE Record that
    describes a given file is called the Base FILE record and the others are
    called Extension FILE Records.
    </p>

    <p>
    A FILE Record is built up from a header, several variable length
    attributes and an end marker (simply 0xFFFFFFFF).

      <dt>Real / Allocated Size</dt>
      <dd>
      The Allocated Size is how much space the Record takes up on disk.
      This should be a multiple of the cluster size and should probably be
      equal to the size of an MFT File Record.  The Real Size is a count
      of how many bytes of the Record are actually used.
      </dd>
      <dd>N.B. The Real Size will be padded to an 8 byte boundary.</dd>

      <dt>Base MFT Record</dt>
      <dd>
      This is zero for Base MFT Records.
      When it is not zero it is a MFT Reference pointing to the Base MFT Record
      to which this Record belongs.  The Base Record contains the information
      about the Extension Record.  This information is stored in an ATTRIBUTE_LIST
      attribute.
      </dd>

      <dt>Next Attribute Id</dt>
      <dd>
      The Attribute Id that will be assigned to the next Attribute added to this
      MFT Record.
      </dd>
      <dd>N.B. Incremented each time it is used.</dd>
      <dd>N.B. Every time the MFT Record is reused this Id is set to zero.</dd>
      <dd>N.B. The first instance number is always 0.</dd>

      <dd>
      The master file table record consists of a header and the attribute list. It has a
      size of 400 (=1K), or the cluster size (whichever is larger). The header has the
      following fields:
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>
    The attribute list is of variable length and terminated with FFFFFFFF. For 1K MFT
    records, the attribute list starts at offset 0x30.
    </p>

    <pre>
    The sequence number is a circular counter (skipping 0) describing how many
    times the referenced mft record has been (re)used. This has to match the
    sequence number of the mft record being referenced, otherwise the reference
    is considered stale and removed (FIXME: only ntfsck or the driver itself?).

    If the sequence number is zero it is assumed that no sequence number
    consistency checking should be performed.

    FIXME: The mft zone is defined as the first 12% of the volume. This space is
    reserved so that the mft can grow contiguously and hence doesn't become
    fragmented. Volume free space includes the empty part of the mft zone and
    when the volume's free 88% are used up, the mft zone is shrunk by a factor
    of 2, thus making more space available for more files/data. This process is
    repeated everytime there is no more free space except for the mft zone until
    there really is no more free space.

    The mft record header present at the beginning of every record in the mft.
    This is followed by a sequence of variable length attribute records which
    is terminated by an attribute of type $END which is a truncated attribute
    in that it only consists of the attribute type code $END and none of the
    other members of the attribute structure are present.

    When (re)using the mft record, we place the update sequence array at this
    offset, i.e. before we start with the attributes. This also makes sense,
    otherwise we could run into problems with the update sequence array
    containing in itself the last two bytes of a sector which would mean that
    multi sector transfer protection wouldn't work. As you can't protect data
    by overwriting it since you then can't get it back...
    When reading we obviously use the data from the ntfs record header.
    </pre>

    <dl>
    <dt>The sequence of attributes part</dt>
    <dd>
    This is a sequence of file attributes that has a variable length. In each FILE
    record, the sequence is ordered by increasing order of the attribute type. The
    sequence is terminated with FF FF FF FF.
    </dd>
    </dl>

    <pre>
    Size defined in $Boot.
    A FILE record is 1 KB large or the cluster size if larger (as far as Helen is
    concerned, its maximum size is 4 KB, but Windows NT 4 limit is 64 KB). It falls into
    2 parts:
    </pre>

    <p>
    Extension FILE records are used when all information about a file doesn't fit into
    the base FILE record (e.g. if the sequence of file attributes grows because the file
    has a lot of file attributes or because the data attribute of the file has a long
    runlist because its stream is very fragmented). Only the base FILE record is used for
    referencing the file it describes. Since the type of the Attribute List file
    attribute is small enough, we are sure that this file attribute will be in the base
    FILE record. And this file attribute provides the references to all the extension
    FILE records describing the file.
    </p>

    <p>
    When a file is deleted, NTFS can't simply remove the associated FILE records from
    the MFT, otherwise FILE record numbers wouldn't be constant over time, and all file
    references would have to be updated! Instead, the in-use flag of a FILE record
    indicates when it is no longer in use. When a file is created, an unused FILE record
    can be re-used for it, but its sequence number is incremented by one. This mechanism
    allow NTFS to check that file references don't point to deleted files.
